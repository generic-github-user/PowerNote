## Who is this project for?

PowerNote is a useful standalone notetaking tool. For most people, however, a tool like OneNote or Google Keep will fit their needs better. PowerNote is closer to a note *aggregation* tool instead of a notetaking tool. It is designed to collect and sync notes from multiple sources and provide powerful and efficient ways to organize them. **Anyone can use it, but it works best for people with hundreds or thousands of text notes across multiple platforms.**
